# ByeBlocker for CHS
Check it out here: https://crestwood-hold-this-l.netlify.app/ - this is a proxy, kinda works like a vpn. put any blocked site, hit enter, and enjoy. 

The only TRULY UNBLOCKABLE proxy that works on Netlify, codepen, playcode, as a bookmarklet, never shows up in your history, and MORE! (The ONLY unblocker that works on static hosts)

Name inspired by Zek-c
